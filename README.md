## Why Rust?

Why Rust? Well, I believe that in a long-term bet the most important thing is to get to the end. For me Rust is by far the most fun option, low level with some little wheels to keep you from falling. Besides, it is very difficult to really learn and understand how to program in a high-level language, because all the algorithms and data structures are done for you; in C by the way, and if you try to do it yourself your solution will be less efficient.
