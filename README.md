## Why Rust?

The main reason I decided to learn Rust is that I want to deepen my programming skills, and for me, Rust represents a long-term investment.

## Rust is Difficult and Rewarding

If something is easy, anyone can learn it at any time—and when everyone can do it, it tends to lose its value. So, should I learn a machine-level language simply because it’s very challenging? Of course not; you probably wouldn’t have enough time in your life to truly master machine-level programming or even build something practical with it.

So, what’s the answer? Rewarding! Rust is a challenging language that is rapidly gaining popularity (challenging and popular—two words that seemingly shouldn’t go together! I don’t mean to impose my opinion, but when I see that something difficult is catching on, it suggests that something very interesting is happening). Critical systems require both speed and security. They demand responsibility and maturity from programmers because a single mistake can have serious consequences.

Of course, you could also enjoy building an ultra-safe, ultra-fast server for just 20 users. I can’t predict the future, but if AI is truly going to improve things, why bet on something that was already easy before AI came along? Instead of producing 10 tons of waste per minute, why not take your solid, proven product and give it the attention it deserves? The short answer is “dopamine”—but I’m no doctor, so I’ll refrain from diving deeper into that discussion.

Since I mentioned AI, here’s one thing I’ve noticed and rarely hear discussed: as complexity increases, AI seems to struggle more. With JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, you can just write something and end up with an entire application. With Kotlin, you need to be more specific. Rust, however—you might need to build with Legos or study hard, because I can’t help you write more than one function at a time.

## Fundamentals

It might sound cliché, but in every field of knowledge, the importance of mastering the fundamentals is emphasized. In my opinion, Rust can be a bit strict and doesn’t give you much leeway to make mistakes and learn from them later. On one hand, this is great because it naturally prevents bad practices. On the other hand, it’s like being warned not to stick your finger into an electrical outlet: it teaches you very clearly why you shouldn’t try it! Of course, no one wants you to stick your finger into an critical application electrical outlet  with 1,000,000 lines (kudos to Rust for that).

In conclusion, after studying Rust a bit, my perspective has shifted in many ways. I’d say, “Rust is a beautiful language that won’t even let you hop on the bike if you don’t know how to pedal.”
